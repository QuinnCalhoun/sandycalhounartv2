                    <Container as='p' content='Born in Vallejo, California in 1966 Sandy Calhoun spent her formative years playing in mud, roller
skating, and dreaming of dancing in a disco. After studying industrial and graphic design at San Francisco
State University for 4 years, she transferred to Chico State University to finish her education, took a
ceramics class to fulfill a general education requirement, and changed her major after the first day of
class. After receiving her BA degree, in ceramics, from Chico State, Sandy turned her attention to raising
a family and her art making moved to the side, though it was never completely abandoned. In 2013, she
decided to reacquaint herself with clay and signed up for a workshop class being led by Tony Natsoulas
at Alpha Fired Arts in Sacramento. In the company of wonderful artists, under the direction of Tony, she
has been able to develop her skills as a ceramic artist, explore her quirks and neurosis, and discover that
art can be weird and funny and personal. Since 2013, Sandy has been in numerous groups shows and
has had a solo show at the Pence Gallery in Davis.' />

                            The essence of my work is not the subject or the medium, but the stories that are discovered that connect the piece to the viewer and to me. I donâ€™t believe I actually create my work as much as discover it as I build.
                            Clay is the perfect material for this discovery as it allows me to experiment and explore as I construct each piece, looking for a way to balance what I know to be a true story with the story that I want to create.
